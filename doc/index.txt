 fable - Automatic Fortran to C++ conversion
=============================================

- **fable** converts fixed-format Fortran sources to C++.
  The generated C++ code is designed to be human-readable and
  suitable for further development. In many cases it can be compiled
  and run without manual intervention.

- fable comes with the C++ **fem** Fortran EMulation library.
  The entire fem library is inlined and therefore very easy
  to use: simply add ``-I/actual/path/fable`` or similar to
  the compilation command.

- The fem library has no dependencies other than a standard C++ compiler.

- fable is written in Python (version 2.x) which comes pre-installed
  with most modern Unix systems. A full Python distribution is included
  in the fable bundle for Windows.

- The name "fable" is short for "Fortran ABLEitung". "Ableitung" is a
  german word which can mean both "derivative" and "branching off".

The ``fable.cout --example`` command is known to work with gcc 3.2 or
higher, Visual C++ 7.1 or higher, and with recent development versions
of clang++.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Converting your sources
=======================

Pure-Fortran programs that don't link against external libraries
can be converted simply with e.g.::

  fable.cout main.f input.f calcs.f output.f --namespace=calcs > calcs.cpp

``fable.cout`` supports ``--run`` to convert and immediately compile,
link, and run the converted C++ code. If there is no ``PROGRAM``,
``--compile`` can be used to quickly test compilation.

Some advanced conversion features, such as suppressing conversion of
certain procedures (SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION, BLOCKDATA, PROGRAM) or conversion
to multiple files are available through a Python interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Major features
==============

Call graph, topological sort, const analysis
--------------------------------------------

fable builds a call graph of all the input sources, performs
a topological sort (with handling of dependency cycles) and
const analysis tracing even through function pointers.
The ``--top-procedure`` option of ``fable.cout`` can be used to
extract only the specified SUBROUTINE or FUNCTION and all its
dependencies; unused procedures are not converted. This feature was
used to produce the
`lapack_fem/selected.hpp <sources/lapack_fem/selected.hpp>`_
example.

No global variables in C++
--------------------------

Fortran programs have two types of global variables, COMMON and SAVE
variables. In addition, the Fortran I/O units are essentially global
variables. fable converts all global variables to C++ struct members
so that the converted C++ code does not have any global variables. In
this way an entire Fortran program is turned into a regular C++
object that is fully encapsulated. Multiple such objects can co-exist
in the same process without interference.

In the converted C++ code, the object holding the originally global
variables is called ``cmn``, short for "common". The state of the I/O
system is stored under ``cmn.io``. All C++ functions using originally
global variables or the I/O system have ``cmn`` inserted as the
first argument.

Example: [`Fortran <sources/fable/test/valid/conv_recipe.f>`_]
[`C++ <conv_recipe.cpp>`_]

Dynamic parameters
------------------

Due to the lack of dynamic memory allocation in Fortran 77, many
existing Fortran programs use PARAMETER to statically define array
sizes. fable supports turning originally static parameters into
"dynamic parameters" as part of the automatic conversion process,
for example::

  fable.cout dp_example.f --dynamic_parameter="int array_size=100" > dp_example.cpp

With this, all occurrences of ``PARAMETER(array_size=...)`` in the
Fortran program are converted to use a dynamic size instead. The
default ``array_size`` in the example is set to 100 (the original
size in the Fortran code is ignored). The ``array_size`` can be set
from the command line with the ``--fem-dynamic-parameters`` option,
e.g.::

  g++ -o dp_example -I/actual/path/fable dp_example.cpp
  dp_example --fem-dynamic-parameters=200

(Note that this option is removed from the list of command-line
arguments as seen by the ``iargc()`` and ``getarg()`` intrinsic
functions.)

Example: [`Fortran <sources/fable/test/valid/dp_example.f>`_]
[`C++ <dp_example.cpp>`_]

Calls into external libraries
-----------------------------

For the automatic const analysis to work correctly, fable needs
to "see" the implementations of all functions called directly or
indirectly. If some Fortran sources are not available or if the
Fortran program calls functions written in other languages, small
"stubs" can be supplied from which fable can derive the correct const
information. For example::

      subroutine qread(iunit, buffer, nitems, result)
      implicit none
      integer iunit, nitems, result
      real buffer(*)
      buffer(1) = 0
      result = 0
      STOP 'FABLE_STUB'
      end

From this stub fable can deduce that ``iunit`` and ``ntimes`` are
const, while ``buffer`` and ``result`` are non-const.  Currently,
the converted C++ code needs to be modified manually to replace the
body of the stub function with a call of the external function.
(Possible but not implemented: automatic replacement of stub bodies
with proper calls.)

EQUIVALENCE and COMMON variants
-------------------------------

Large Fortran programs tend to make use of EQUIVALENCE and "common
variants". A simple example of a common variant is::

  program main
  common /chunk/ a(200)
  ...
  end

  subroutine sub1
  common /chunk/ x(100), y(100)
  ...
  end

fable is designed to handle all legal combinations of common
variants and EQUIVALENCE, but the generated C++ code is
cluttered quite badly with ``mbr<>`` and ``bind<>`` statements
(e.g. [`Fortran <sources/fable/test/valid/common_variants.f>`_]
[`C++ <common_variants.cpp>`_]). If the generated C++ code is
meant to be a basis for future development, it is a good idea
to consider modifying the Fortran code before finalizing the
conversion. Sometimes common variants are accidental and can easily be
avoided. To help in detecting such cases, ``fable.cout`` writes a file
``fable_cout_common_report`` (`example <fable_cout_common_report>`_)
which shows the differences between the variants.

The use of Fortran EQUIVALENCE also leads to clutter in the
generated C++ code. For equivalences involving common variables,
``fable_cout_common_report`` shows a list of the problem cases, sorted
by volume of the corresponding generated code. If it is known that the
equivalences do not affect the size of a common block, the ``fable.cout
--common-equivalence-simple`` option can be used to direct fable to
generate much less cluttered C++ code for handling the equivalences.
(Possible but not implemented: automatic detection of simple
equivalences.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended conversion workflow
===============================

In our experience, for large-scale programs (with more than a few
thousand lines of code) the ability to quickly test the implementation
is a crucial pre-requisite for a successful conversion to concise C++
code. Therefore the conversion workflow should start with building a
suite of tests. Ideally running the tests should execute each line
of code at least once, but this is often difficult to achieve. In
practice it may be fully sufficient to work with tests that call each
subroutine at least once. The second most important aspect of a test
suite is that it is fast. Long wait times tend to lead to developer
fatigue and compromises in the interest of time. The result may be
unnecessarily cluttered C++ code, hampering future developments. Quick
tests give the developer a chance to try alternative transformations of
the Fortran sources and different conversion options. Post conversion,
the tests can be invaluable again during manual optimizations of the
generated C++ code.

Once tests are in place, the conversion workflow consists of cycles of:

 - Running fable to generate C++ code.
 - Analyzing conversion problems.
 - Modifying the Fortran sources with the goal to obtain better C++ code
   (e.g. by reworking COMMON blocks or eliminating EQUIVALENCE statements),
   or to work around limitations of fable.
 - Running the tests with a Fortran-compiled executable to validate the
   Fortran changes.

This sequence is repeated until the generated C++ code can be compiled
and linked, so that testing with a C++-compiled executable can be
inserted into the cycle. As soon as the C++ executable passes all
tests, it is possible to leave the Fortran source behind and continue
with development of the C++ code, but it may be very useful to continue
changing the Fortran sources to improve the generated C++ code,
and/or to experiment with the ``--common-equivalence-simple`` option.

Conceivably there are situations in which it is best to modify the
fable code generation rather than the Fortran sources. This was an
important reason for releasing fable as open source (see also below).

We found that Python's ``multiprocessing`` module (Python 2.6 or
higher) is extremely helpful in parallelizing execution of tests. Given
a modern multi-core machine it is realistic to expect completion of
a full modify-build-test cycle in a couple minutes, even for programs
with 100k+ lines of original Fortran code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

fable/fem components and completeness
=====================================

The main fable components are ``fable.read`` and ``fable.cout``.
The reader is supported by ``fable.tokenization``. The tokenization
fully supports the Fortran 77 syntax and some Fortran 90 features
(as used by LAPACK). The reader supports a nearly complete subset of
Fortran 77 and a very small subset of Fortran 90 features. The C++
code generation supports a large subset of Fortran 77. It may insert
"UNHANDLED" messages into the output or even fail completely while
processing unusual constructs.

Development of the fem Fortran emulation library was guided by the
requirements of the programs we have converted for our needs. The
emulation of the I/O system may raise "Not implemented" exceptions
during execution. A major component missing completely is the runtime
support for direct-access files. Several unusual FORMAT edits are not
supported. Some floating-point edits are emulated only approximately.

A major reason for releasing fable and fem under an open source
license is to enable users to continually complete and improve the
implementations, and possibly reuse fable as a framework for other
target languages. fable comes with a large set of unit tests so that
any changes made can be quickly verified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fortran vs. C++ data types
==========================

fable assumes that the Fortran INTEGER type is a C++ ``int``, REAL is
a C++ ``float``, and DOUBLE PRECISION is a C++ ``double``. On most
current computing platforms, the sizes of the Fortran types should
be identical to the sizes of the corresponding C++ types. The only
exception is the mapping of the Fortran LOGICAL type to the C++
``bool`` type. In this case we found it more important to map the
concept rather than the implementation detail that a LOGICAL usually
occupies four bytes while the size of a C++ ``bool`` is usually
one byte. This small asymmetry has to be kept in mind when calling
external libraries from FABLE-generated C++. The Fortran complex types
are mapped to the C++ ``std::complex`` template class in the Standard
Template Library (STL). Fortran CHARACTER strings are mapped to the
``fem::str`` template class in the fem library.

A complete list of Fortran data types supported by fable is in the
example file
`doc_data_type_star.f <sources/fable/test/valid/doc_data_type_star.f>`_.
Running ``fable.cout`` with this file will
`show all mappings to C++ types <doc_data_type_star.cpp>`_.
Relevant files in the fem library are
`data_type_star.hpp <sources/fable/fem/data_type_star.hpp>`_,
`int_types.hpp <sources/fable/fem/utils/int_types.hpp>`_, and
`zero.hpp <sources/fable/fem/zero.hpp>`_.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

fable array and array-reference types
=====================================

The fem library implements a family of array and array-reference
types. The main type is the ``arr`` class template::

  arr<int> one_dimensional(dimension(10));
  arr<int, 2> two_dimensional(dimension(10, 20));

The first template parameter is the data type, the second parameter
specifies the number of dimensions; the default number of dimensions is
``1`` and can be omitted. The ``dimension`` statements shown imply
one-based indexing. An example of a two-dimensional array with a
different offset is::

  arr<int, 2> two_dimensional(dim1(-2,3).dim2(-4,5));

fable supports up to six dimensions.
The `arr` class template uses dynamic memory allocation. An alternative
is used for small arrays with sizes <= 256, for example::

  arr_1d<int, 3> vector;
  arr_2d<int, 3, 3> matrix;

Here the size of each dimension is fixed at compile time. Small arrays
are allocated on the stack to avoid dynamic memory allocation overhead.

Arrays are passed to functions via array-reference types, for example::

  void sub1(arr_ref<int, 2> matrix) { ... }
  void sub2(arr_cref<int, 2> matrix) { ... }

``arr_ref`` indicates that the array is modified in the function;
``arr_cref`` guarantees that the array is not modified in the function.
The extra ``c`` in the second type name is short for ``const``.
To emulate the Fortran behavior, scalars and arrays of non-matching
dimensionality or sizes can be passed to an array reference in a
function call. The sizes of the dimensions are set inside the called
functions, for example::

  matrix(dimension(10, 20));

The syntax for setting the sizes is identical to that used for
``arr`` types as shown above.

Strings are handled via a dedicated family of types, for example::

  fem::str<4> key = "name";

The template parameter specifies the number of characters.
Strings are passed in this way::

  void sub1(str_ref line) { ... }
  void sub2(str_cref line) { ... }

Passing of string arrays also requires special types::

  void sub1(str_arr_ref<1> text) { ... }
  void sub2(str_arr_cref<2> text) { ... }

These types had to be introduced to emulate the implicit passing
of string lengths in Fortran. The template parameter specifies the
number of dimensions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Miscellaneous practical remarks
===============================

- If fable error messages are not clear, use a Fortran compiler
  to obtain potentially better messages.

- A quick directed way to find out how fable converts certain
  Fortran features is to write a tiny Fortran program and convert
  it with ``fable.cout``.

- Do not hesitate to inspect the fem sources. The fem implementations
  are written in a minimalistic style, avoiding smart but unobvious
  tricks to increase readability. (The price is a certain amount of
  redundancy in the code, for example in the implementations of the
  multi-dimensional array index calculations.)

- Do not hesitate to ask questions about the fem library.

- Be prepared to find that the ``cout.py`` script is the densest and
  least organized part of the fable package.
